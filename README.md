# Hero Crusade
Hero Crusade is a turn base JRPG game. Where you can explore, slay
and have the freedom todo what ever you like. Want to burn down a 
village you can. Those who survive will form a new village, and will
remember what you did. Want to craft your own weapon, armor, and items
you can with realistic item crafting, and forging. Want to dive deep 
into the arcane you can with a diverse, and expanding magic system. 
These are all feature I want to implement and more. If you have any
ideas you can email me at ryandelaney184@gmail.com.

customizable, and will copy the DLL files if your windows to the final
